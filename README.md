# embedded_helper

This repository is ideal for beginner to intermediate engineers 
working with C, C++, or embedded systems, and aims to help them 
understand key concepts in these languages.

To build the project:


1: As a dump of binaries:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

All the binaries will be there in build/bins

2: As an app:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
ccmake..
#enable the eH_App
 make
```
the app binary will be present in the build/.
